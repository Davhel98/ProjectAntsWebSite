# Background Images

This directory will contain background images for the website.

For now, the CSS includes a fallback gradient background that will be used until a proper background image is added.

To add a background image:
1. Add your image file as `background.jpg` in this directory
2. The CSS is already configured to use `../images/background.jpg`

Recommended image specifications:
- Format: JPG or PNG
- Resolution: 1920x1080 or higher
- Aspect ratio: 16:9
- File size: Under 2MB for optimal loading
- Theme: Should match the game's aesthetic
